        ## üìã Minimal reproduction
        > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue closure warning**: Without a minimal reproduction URL, your issue will be closed & locked without response.

        The minimal reproduction is the core of your issue. Most times, this is all we look at to understand the problem.

        When we debug your reproduction, we start by removing everything unncessary. Including converting TypeScript to JavaScript where possible, and removing _all_ unnecessary files & code (especially inside `node_modules`).
        Minimizing the scope of the problem helps reveal the root cause.

        <details>
            <summary><strong>Guidelines for creating a Minimal Reproduction</strong></summary>

        1. **Eliminate extra files**: Limit to under 10 files. Discard non-essential files (like `LICENSE`, `.npmrc`, `.github`) and trim extraneous properties from `package.json`.

        2. **Concentrate on the Issue**: Focus solely on the bug. Exclude unrelated frontend/backend components. If it's a TypeScript issue, convert to JavaScript for clarity. Aim for minimal lines of code in a single file.

        3. **Configure 'start' script**: In `package.json`, ensure the `start` script clearly demonstrates the bug.

        4. **Thorough verification**: Test the reproduction yourself. Confirm immediate reproducibility, proper dependency declarations, and absence of redundant code or files. This mirrors the maintainers' process of scrutinizing every aspect.

        5. **Upload**: Share your minimal reproduction on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) or a new GitHub repository, ensuring it's accessible via a browser.

        **Starter Template**: [Fork this StackBlitz template](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-huzszn?file=index.ts)

        The more refined and concise your reproduction, the faster and more effectively maintainers can address your issue.
